Hi friends, we archive channels that have been quiet for 60 days. This channel has been quiet for 50 days so far.

Archiving a channel removes it from the list of active channels and prevents new comments from being made there.

All existing comments in the channel are retained for easy browsing and searching and can be read like any other channel. If a need for this particular channel arises again, it can be unarchived by any user here. If you’d like to keep this channel active, just _say anything_ and we’ll reset the timer. If we don’t hear from anyone in the next 30 days, this channel will be archived.

If you’d like to request a permanent exception for this channel, please visit #slack-meta.
